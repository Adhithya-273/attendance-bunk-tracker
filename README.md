## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This application uses a combination of powerful Python libraries:

- **Flask**: Acts as the back-end web server, handling user requests and displaying the results.
- **Selenium**: Automates a real web browser (Google Chrome) in the background to log in and navigate the college website just like a human would.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Parses the HTML of the attendance page to accurately extract the subject and attendance data.
